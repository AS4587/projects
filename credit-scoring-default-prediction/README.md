# Credit Scoring Default Prediction

## Overview
This project builds a credit-scoring model to predict customer default risk. It includes data preprocessing, EDA, model training, and hyperparameter tuning with a focus on ROC-AUC performance.

## Project Structure
- `credit-scoring.ipynb` — main notebook with data preparation, modeling, and evaluation.
- `readme.md` — original project notes (Russian).

## Data
The notebook uses a Kaggle credit scoring dataset. See the notebook for data loading details.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook/Lab
- pandas, numpy, scikit-learn

## Usage
1. Open `credit-scoring.ipynb` in Jupyter.
2. Run the cells to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate performance.

## Results
Model metrics, including ROC-AUC, are shown in the notebook output cells.

## Notes
- The original notes remain in `readme.md` for reference.
- Update dataset paths if needed.
