# YOLOv5 Training and Comparison

## Overview
This notebook focuses on training a YOLOv5 model, including dataset preparation, labeling, and training workflows. It documents preprocessing steps and visualizes detection results.

## Project Structure
- `faster-rcnn-compare-yolo.ipynb` — data loading, preprocessing, YOLO formatting, training, and visualization steps.

## Data
The notebook expects image datasets with labels that are converted into YOLO format. See the notebook for dataset paths and preprocessing details.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook/Lab
- Typical CV/ML stack (e.g., numpy, pandas, torch, OpenCV)
- YOLOv5 dependencies as configured in the notebook

## Usage
1. Open `faster-rcnn-compare-yolo.ipynb` in Jupyter.
2. Run the cells to prepare data, train YOLOv5, and review visualizations.

## Results
Training metrics and example detections are shown in the notebook output cells.

## Notes
- Update dataset paths and label conversion settings as needed.
- Training time depends on dataset size and hardware resources.
