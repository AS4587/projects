# Student Math Performance EDA

## Overview
This project analyzes how living conditions and student characteristics (ages 15–22) relate to math performance. It focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature processing, and identifying risk factors for low scores.

## Project Structure
- `STAT&Project.ipynb` — notebook with data cleaning, transformation, and EDA.
- `STAT&Project_readme.txt` — original project description and reflection (Russian).

## Data
The dataset includes demographic, family, and academic variables, along with a math exam score.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook/Lab
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib/seaborn (or similar EDA libraries)

## Usage
1. Open `STAT&Project.ipynb` in Jupyter.
2. Run the notebook to reproduce the analysis and plots.

## Results
Key findings and conclusions are documented within the notebook.

## Notes
- If you need a translated or extended write-up, expand `STAT&Project_readme.txt` or create a dedicated report file.
