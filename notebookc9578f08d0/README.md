# Modeling Workflow Notebook

## Overview
This notebook walks through a full ML workflow, including data preparation, transformations, visualization, model training, and conclusions about model performance.

## Project Structure
- `notebookc9578f08d0.ipynb` — data prep, transformation, visualization, and model training notebook.

## Data
The notebook uses a dataset loaded in the initial cells. Refer to the notebook for data source details and preprocessing logic.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook/Lab
- Typical ML stack (e.g., pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib)

## Usage
1. Open `notebookc9578f08d0.ipynb` in Jupyter.
2. Run the cells to prepare data, train the model, and review results.

## Results
Model performance metrics and visualizations are included in the notebook output cells.

## Notes
- Update dataset paths as needed for your environment.
- Adjust model parameters in the training section to experiment.
