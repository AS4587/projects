# Anapa Flights EDA & Feature Engineering

## Overview
This project performs EDA and feature engineering on flight data for Anapa Airport. It inspects flight performance, seat utilization, and revenue-related metrics to prepare features for downstream analysis or modeling.

## Project Structure
- `EDA&future_eng.ipynb` — EDA and feature engineering notebook.
- `anapa_flights.csv` — flight dataset used by the notebook.
- `answers.txt` — notes or answers tied to the analysis.

## Data
`anapa_flights.csv` contains flight records with schedule details, aircraft info, seat counts, and revenue metrics.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook/Lab
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib/seaborn

## Usage
1. Open `EDA&future_eng.ipynb` in Jupyter.
2. Run the cells to reproduce the analysis and feature engineering steps.

## Results
Key plots and findings are embedded in the notebook output.

## Notes
- Ensure the CSV is in the same directory as the notebook or update the path accordingly.
