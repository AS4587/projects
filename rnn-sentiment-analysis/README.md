# RNN Sentiment Analysis (LSTM/GRU)

## Overview
This project explores sentiment analysis using recurrent neural networks (RNNs), including LSTM and GRU architectures. It focuses on text preprocessing, sequence modeling, and performance evaluation.

## Project Structure
- `RNN_practice_kag.ipynb` — main notebook with preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
- `txt/` — supporting text assets used by the notebook.

## Data
The notebook loads and preprocesses sentiment-labeled text data. Refer to the notebook for dataset details and sources.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook/Lab
- Typical ML stack (e.g., pandas, numpy, scikit-learn)
- Deep learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch)

## Usage
1. Open `RNN_practice_kag.ipynb` in Jupyter.
2. Run all cells to train LSTM/GRU models and compare results.

## Results
Evaluation metrics and comparison results are recorded in the notebook output.

## Notes
- Update dataset paths in the notebook if your local structure differs.
