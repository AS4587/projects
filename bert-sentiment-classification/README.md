# BERT Sentiment Classification

## Overview
This project fine-tunes a BERT-based model for sentiment classification. It focuses on preparing text data, training the model, and evaluating sentiment predictions.

## Project Structure
- `bert-sentiment-classification.ipynb` — data preparation, model training, and evaluation notebook.
- `txt/` — supporting text assets used by the notebook.

## Data
The notebook works with sentiment-labeled text data. See the notebook for dataset loading and preprocessing details.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook/Lab
- Typical ML stack (e.g., pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, transformers, torch)

## Usage
1. Open `bert-sentiment-classification.ipynb` in Jupyter.
2. Run the cells in order to preprocess data, fine-tune the model, and review metrics.

## Results
Results and model evaluation metrics are captured in the notebook output cells.

## Notes
- Paths and dataset locations are defined within the notebook.
- Adjust hyperparameters in the training section as needed.
