# Face Mask Detection Comparison

## Overview
This project compares YOLO-based and Faster R-CNN approaches for detecting face masks. It includes data preparation, model training, and result visualization to evaluate detection quality.

## Project Structure
- `face-mask.ipynb` — data preparation, training, and comparison of YOLO and Faster R-CNN models.

## Data
The notebook works with labeled face mask image datasets. See the notebook for dataset paths, annotations, and preprocessing steps.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook/Lab
- Typical CV/ML stack (e.g., numpy, pandas, torch, torchvision, OpenCV)
- YOLO training dependencies (as configured in the notebook)

## Usage
1. Open `face-mask.ipynb` in Jupyter.
2. Run the cells to prepare data, train models, and visualize results.

## Results
Model comparisons and example visualizations are captured in the notebook output cells.

## Notes
- Adjust dataset paths and training configurations inside the notebook as needed.
- Training requirements may vary depending on GPU availability.
